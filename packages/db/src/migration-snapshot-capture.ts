// Read-only snapshot capture for migration rehearsal (M18.01, #1181).
//
// Capture is the WRITE side of nothing: it reads real product records and
// produces the frozen snapshot documents the comparator in
// `migration-snapshot-comparator.ts` consumes. It never backfills, deletes,
// cuts over or rolls anything back — every read below runs inside ONE
// REPEATABLE READ, READ ONLY transaction, so the database structurally
// refuses the capture a write and every family is observed at a single
// database snapshot (families and pages can never mix states).
//
// Design, mirroring the comparator's epistemics:
//
// - CONSISTENT SNAPSHOT: `captureMigrationSnapshot` opens one transaction
//   with `MIGRATION_SNAPSHOT_CAPTURE_TRANSACTION_CONFIG`; the whole document
//   is read inside it. `captureMigrationSnapshotInTransaction` runs the same
//   read inside a caller-owned transaction that already holds the snapshot.
// - PAGINATION + EXPLICIT COMPLETENESS: every family read is offset-paginated
//   (the repo's search-paging convention) with a one-row probe per page, so
//   exhaustion is proven, not assumed. A scan that stops at the family bound
//   before exhausting the domain records `truncated: true` plus the applied
//   `limit` on the section; an exhausted scan records `truncated: false`.
//   Missing truncation evidence can never imply completeness — `truncated`
//   is always present, exactly what the comparator requires.
// - UNSUPPORTED DOMAINS STAY UNKNOWN: capture only inventories its supported
//   families. A requested domain outside the support set returns a domain
//   status of `unknown` with a typed reason and simply leaves the section
//   absent from the document — the comparator reads an absent section as
//   `unknown_domain`, never as an empty success.
// - DETERMINISM: output carries only the comparator's allow-listed record
//   fields; records are ordered by the comparator's stable identity (a plain
//   code-unit sort, independent of database collation and page size);
//   sections are emitted in contract-family order; the invitation lifecycle
//   state is derived from an injectable `capturedAt` instead of the wall
//   clock. The same database state with the same identity inputs yields
//   byte-identical documents. No credentials, DSNs, message bodies, emails,
//   token digests or timestamps travel — the record contract excludes them
//   and capture never selects them.
//
// Scope honesty: capture feeds comparison; neither is migration acceptance.
// The database handle (or DSN-derived connection) is always an explicit
// argument — nothing here reads `DATABASE_URL` or defaults to any
// environment. Rows whose values exceed the snapshot contract's documented
// bounds are carried verbatim and will be quarantined by the comparator as
// typed `limit` issues; capture never drops or repairs a row silently.
