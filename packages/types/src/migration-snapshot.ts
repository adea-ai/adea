// Frozen migration-snapshot documents for migration rehearsal (M18.01, #1181).
//
// A snapshot document is a bounded, structured inventory of real product and
// runtime records captured from one deployment at one point in time: stable
// ids, history digests, audience and grant identities, conversation links,
// read frontiers and execution-attempt ownership. The comparator in
// `@adea-ai/db` consumes two frozen documents (before / after) and reports
// typed findings; it never touches a live database.
//
// The record shapes below are derived from what `packages/db/src` persists
// today (workspaces, memberships, invitations, auth identities, temporary
// sessions, projects, project members, channels, participants, messages,
// tasks, agents, content refs, durable events, read state, execution
// attempts). They deliberately carry NO message bodies, NO email addresses,
// NO tokens or token digests, NO ciphertext and NO key material — the record
// contract excludes every field a leak would need, so comparator output is
// clean by construction.
//
// Epistemics (fail-closed): a family section that is absent from a document
// makes that domain `unknown` — never zero. A scan that hit its bound is
// flagged `truncated`; a section whose truncation evidence is missing is a
// structure error, never a silent claim of completeness. A record that is
// malformed, over a documented bound, or whose audience/ownership
// classification is ambiguous, is `quarantined` and excluded from matching.
// Identifier and digest fields are format- and length-bounded, and every
// record — of any shape, primitives and top-level arrays included — is
// bounded on total bytes, property slots and array width BEFORE any
// canonicalization — including fields destined to be ignored as extra
// properties and records already headed for a quarantine path — so a hostile
// or corrupt value can never be canonicalized first, and can never travel
// into comparator findings verbatim. Inconclusive input can never yield a
// success verdict.
